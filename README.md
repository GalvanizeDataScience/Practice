### Does the Choice of College Matter in a Job Market ?

Question - Good and prestigious colleges have low acceptance rate (admissions / number of applications). Does the chances of getting a better paying job gets better by going to a colleges with low acceptance rate ? 

Project Setup - Got the college/university data from tuitiontracker.org. Initial thought was to compare diversity and tuition fee with a potential better paying job. While doing the EDA, acceptance rate at colleges seemed to be a better choice. 

Pay data was grabbed from payscale.com by web-scraping. 

Hypothesis: Null H0 - Going to a better college doesn't help getting a better paying job. 

Hypothesis: Alternate HA - going to a better college does help get a better paying job. 

Analysis Methods: The tech stack consists of Python 3, Numpy, Pandas, Beautiful Soup, SciPy, Matplotlib, HTML, and CSS.

Results: There was enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that going to a better college doesn't help to get a better paying job. 

Future questions: Is this also true for Graduate schools? How about doctorate and post-doctorate degrees?
